                            I’m Arabella Morgado, 21 years old. My academic journey began at St. Christine Elementary School, continued at 
                            St. Christine National High School, and progressed through senior high school under the General Academic Strand. 
                            These formative experiences shaped who I am today and prepared me for the challenges of higher education.
